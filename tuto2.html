    <h1>More information on turtles</h1>

    <p>Turtles have existed on our planet for over 200 million years, having weathered mass extinctions, adapted to new habitats, and developed phenomenal biological traits. There are around 356 species of turtles found around the globe, in habitats that include arid deserts to wet rainforests, lakes, rivers, swamps, and vast oceans. While they fall short of the diversity seen in birds and mammals, turtles show a remarkable range of forms, habits, and adaptations that attest to their long and determined survival on Earth.</p>

    <p>Words used for turtles are problematic. From a strict biological standpoint, tortoises are a subcategory of turtles that live exclusively on land, with high-domed shells and pillar-like legs specially suited to walking. Terrapins typically refer to freshwater species smaller than most turtles, like the diamondback terrapin. Unofficially, "turtle" frequently is an all-encompassing term for all these animals, regardless of whether they live on the ground or in the water.</p>

<p>Turtles come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Some, the pancake-form of the musk turtle, for example, are no bigger than the palm of a human hand. Others, like the gigantic leatherback sea turtle, grow over 1.5 meters in length and weigh nearly 1 ton. Based on their way of life, their shells have developed to meet their needs—terrestrial turtles develop thick, dome-shaped shells for protection, and aquatic turtles develop lighter, streamlined shells to aid in swimming. There are some that are semi-aquatic, like the Eastern box turtle, which switch easily from land to water.</p>

<p>Many turtles, especially red-eared sliders, are domesticated. Their curiosity and their attractive appearance make them pets within families and in classrooms. Popularity can be risky, however. Many wild turtles are harvested for the pet trade, usually the brightly colored or unusual species. Removals, habitat loss, and pollution have placed some species in danger of extinction.</p>

<p>Humans have been using turtles for thousands of years. In history and in the present, they have been highly valued for their meat, eggs, shells, and even their symbolism. The hawksbill turtle, for instance, has been hunted all over the world in the past for its shell, which was used to make jewelry and ornaments. The eggs of turtles are collected to eat in most parts of the globe, and adult turtles are killed to be eaten. One pitiful example is Malaysia's leatherback turtle population, which dwindled from thousands to nearly zero in the 1990s because of continued egg and adult harvesting.</p>

<p>In China and Southeast Asia, pressure on turtles has increased over the last few decades. Many species are being harvested for food markets, traditional medicine, and exotic pets. Others, including the golden coin turtle, have become so valued that individuals fetch tens of thousands of dollars on the black market. This demand is non-sustainable and has extirpated wild populations across the region.</p>

<p>The turtle shell is nature's greatest adaptation. Unlike all other vertebrates, the spine and ribs of the turtle have become a bony outer covering. The structure consists of the top carapace and bottom plastron, which provide protection and support. The shape of the shell may be determined by the lifestyle of the turtle. Tortoises generally have high, dome-shaped shells that protect them from predators. Aquatic turtles, however, possess smoother and more rounded shells in order to make swimming easier. Pancake tortoises are just one type with very thin, pliable shells to allow them to burrow into extremely thin crevices of rocks.</p>

<p>The turtles are divided into two broad groups based on how they retract their heads. Cryptodires retract their necks directly into the shell, but pleurodires flex their necks in sideways under the shell. They also have a bearing upon their feeding mechanics and jaw. Certain aquatic pleurodires, for example, employ suction feeding to capture tiny fish or invertebrates by rapidly expanding their throats and mouths.</p>

<p>Although turtles lack teeth, they have firm beak-like jaws composed of keratin—the same protein that forms human fingernails. These beaks are highly specialized to their diets. Herbivorous turtles utilize broad, serrated edges to slice plant material, and carnivorous turtles may have hooked beaks to tear flesh or crush hard shells. Most turtles swallow food whole, relying on muscular throats and digestive systems to break down their meals.</p>

<p>Their senses are sufficiently developed as well. Turtles have sufficient vision, especially underwater, and some even have color vision. While their hearing in comparison to mammals is less acute, they may still sense low-frequency vibrations and sounds, which can be utilized to detect predators or conspecific movement. They also have sufficient smell and, in some species, tactile barbels near the mouth that can be employed to sense food or navigate cloudy waters.</p>

<p>Turtles are found on every continent except Antarctica. North America, South America, and Southeast Asia are some of the geographical areas that have the majority of species. In the United States alone, there are turtles like the box turtle, painted turtle, and alligator snapping turtle that live in habitats ranging from forests to rivers. In South and Southeast Asia, there are softshell turtles, flapshells, and giant river turtles that live in rice fields, river banks, and flooded forests.</p>

<p>The density of turtles may be highly variable. In some environments, such as urban ponds or hot wetlands, turtles like the red-eared slider may thrive—more than 100 per hectare in some places. Other endangered ones like the bog turtle or the giant South American river turtle may be found only in discrete patches and frequently have declining populations because of habitat loss or overcollection.</p>

<p>While turtles are usually solitary animals, many species live harmoniously together within the same habitat. Different species will live within various ecological niches. They may consume different prey species, bask at different hours of the day, or nest in different areas. Juveniles often consume different food than adults, reducing age group competition. Some young turtles are more carnivorous and tend towards a plant-dominant diet as adults.</p>

<p>Turtles are under threat from many natural threats. Eggs and hatchlings are particularly vulnerable to predators such as snakes, raccoons, birds, and fish. Even the adults are vulnerable to attacks by big predators such as sharks, crocodiles, and jaguars. However, in the present times, threats to turtles are mostly from humans. Habitat destruction, pollution, trade, and global warming have exacted a high price on turtles across the globe.</p>

<p>In order to guarantee the survival of turtles, coordinated conservation efforts are required. These include habitat protection, halting illegal trade, breeding programs, and awareness campaigns about the significance of these creatures. Turtles have important ecological roles—they regulate vegetation, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. To save turtles is to safeguard the ecosystems that we all depend on.</p>
