        <h1>Plastic Murders, and we are next...</h1>
  
         

        


        <p>

        Plastic kills many animals and is thrown in the ocean, to be precised a whole trash truck throws waste into the ocean about every minute .</p>
         
         <p>

         Approximately 11 million metric tons of plastic enters the ocean each year, This is equivalent to dumping 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic into the ocean, rivers, and lakes every day, according to UNEP. </p>

         <p>While 8 million metric tons of plastic is estimated to enter the ocean annually. Turtles think that plastic bag are jellyfish and it kills turtles and other sea animals due to that.<br></p>

        So much plastic is thrown into the ocean that a seventh continent that is 6 times larger than france exists now that is 30 meters deep, it is formerd by micro-plastic and many sea animals inhale this substance and most of those animals finish their live in our plate, making us eat plastic! </p>
